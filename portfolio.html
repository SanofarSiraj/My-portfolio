            Object-Oriented-Programming: <br>
              In the course project we used concepts of OOP to develop an application for Hotel Management system. I worked on developing following features: 
            - Creating customer profile when booking for the first time.
            - Booking a room according to preference of customer. 
            - Allow customer to change room and activities.
            - Display available rooms for booking. 
            - Search booking details by customer name.
            - Storage of Booking Information and Customer Details: 
            The application could store All booking information and customer details in text file using java file operations.
             This allowed the application to be closed and still retain booking information and customer details in text file. 
             This also allowed the application to retrieve booking and customer details when the application started. <br>
            
            Tools: Install IntelliJ IDE for Java application development.
            Language: Java<br><br>

            Systematic software development with Java: <br>
           (Skills: Linux and commands, git, shell scripting, working with ubuntu and docker, bash, AWS, GitHub, Jenkins, Client Application development, server application development using Maven & Insomnia tools), 

          As a part of the course project we  Created  Server application and Client application and interaction between them:
          As a part of this assignment I created 
       - a server application to provide services/APIs for creating blogs, modifying blogs, searching blogs, deleting blogs. 
       - The server application was configured inside a Docker container . 
       - The client application will connect to the server application docker container and call server APIs for creation, searching, modifying, deletions of blogs. 

        - Here I combined my knowledge from OOP for storing blog information at server side. 
        - List of blog information entered by client application was stored in text file at server side. 
        - Git repository was used for tracking my development work. <br>
        Tools: Install IntelliJ IDE for Java application development. Docker, GitHub, Insomnia, Ubuntu
        Language: Java, shell scripting, bash
           <br><br>

           Database Management:<br>
           The project is to set up a database of different courses, such as the company 
           VLDIT AB provides to various corporate customers by acquiring 4NF.
           Tools:Virtual Machine,MysqlWork bench
           <br><br>
           
           Cloud Computing:<br>
           Assuming as a software developer at the company VLDIT AB. I had to investigate the option to use AWS as a platform for our development.
           VLDIT AB has standardized its development platform to the following:
         - Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04.
         - Development tools: Visual Studio Code
           Programming languages: Java
          - Framework: Spring Boot
          - Database Engine: MySQL 8
          - Cloud service: AWS
        A first step is to use virtual machines as a platform. Virtual machine must contain the tools required to develop and to
be able to handle the cloud service AWS.Requirements: The development environment must be easy to reproduce, restore and be
based on services for IaaS. A functioning environment for development in AWS where I have used Terraform as framework for IaC, with accompanying documentation that complies
requirements as above. <br>

Tools :Virtual machine,AWS Management Console<br><br>

Web Development:
Creating website using html and css.<br>
Tools:Visual Studio code<br>
